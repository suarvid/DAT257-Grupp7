What do I want to learn or understand better?
My goal with this assignment is to gain experience from working with a diverse team. I believe there are many things that student from different programs at Chalmers can share with each other, both regarding skills and experiences. I am thrilled to see what I can learn from students studying IT. 

I also want to gain experience how to work together with a large development project, as this is something I havenâ€™t yet experienced.  Under the circumstances I also think this assignment will be a great way to learn how to work efficient and effective using digital tools to communicate compare to the traditional ways of meeting. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Studying IE&M, I am used to taking contact with companies in different markets. This knowledge can help us make contact and establish a project that is feasible for us to conduct during this course. I am also used to working with understand new types of concepts, so I believe that I can help them that are inexperienced with Scrum. 

I am also well experienced in working within in a team, as this is something that I have done in many courses at Chalmers as well as in other commitments.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
Learn and understand how to apply Scrum. By doing so I will be able to share my understanding with others so that everybody will reach an adequate level of understanding.  

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
I believe that I can come up with different ideas how to solve problems and frame those problem in a way that makes them manageable. At the moment we are still in the start-up phase of our project. Thereby I haven't been able to contribute except for being active in our meetings when discussing potential ideas.
